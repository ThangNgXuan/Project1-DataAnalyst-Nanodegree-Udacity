# Seattle_Airbnb_Data_Analyst

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Installing certain essential libraries is required, including those for Numpy, Pandas, Matplolib, and Seaborn. Python versions 3.* should work with the code without any problems.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I implement the analysis on Seattle Airbnb Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) to get some insights from there:
- What neighborhood in Seattle has the best price?
- The cost per night comparison for the various types of properties?
- The pricing range/distribution for reservations?

## File Descriptions
- There are 3 datasets including calendar, listings, and reviews.
- There is 1 jupiter notebook containing the data analysis.
## Post Blogs<a name="results"></a>

Because of my company network, I cannot connect to Medium to write any sharing Blogs in here. So, maybe I feel free try a workarroud writing in Notion instead. 

My reports you can see in this available link [here](https://plum-pedestrian-ee8.notion.site/Seattle-Airbnb-Analysis-36c4fe2d80d14a6ba881b9d44d635c9d)
